I currently run a grid trading strategy on my Expert Advisor (EA). Here is an overview of how the strategy works:<br /><br />
Trigger for Trades: The opening of trades is dictated by candle closures. Specifically:<br />
A bearish candle results in a sell order.<br />
A bullish candle results in a buy order.<br />
Multiplicator and Fixed Lot: Each subsequent order uses a multiplicator and a fixed lot size.<br />
Step and Take Profit: There is a predetermined step between orders, and a take profit (TP) level is set for each trade.<br />
No Stop Loss: Currently, no stop loss is used in this strategy.<br />
Improvement Goals<br />
I want to improve the strategy to:<br /><br />
Limit risk while maintaining a profitability rate of 5-15% per month.<br />
Implement a hard stop loss based on a percentage of the account&#039;s equity.<br />
Integrate hedging to manage drawdown and profit when the EA is on the wrong side of the market, awaiting a retracement to hit the TP.<br />
Request for Expert Input<br />
Job Description:<br />

All data that needs to be persisted is stored in AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).<br /><br />
- Key design principles<br />
Our review of the scope of work (SOW) and our experience with and understanding of the history and current state of the ASAP service led us to a summary of the key design principles:<br />
&bull; Serverless<br />
&bull; Standards-based<br />
&bull; A stateless messaging hub/service bus<br />
&bull; Transient storage<br />

Then here&#039;s a quick but interesting task for you. <br /><br />
What&#039;s the task?<br />
- There is this Github repo here: https://github.com/moononournation/node-jdbc-connection/<br />
- This Github repo allows to connect to certain databases via JDBC<br />
- However, we&#039;d need to connect to another database (SAP Advantage) which is not yet supported by this repo. We already have a JDBC driver (as .jar file). <br />
- The goal of this task is that the repo is extended so that we can also connect to the new database using the new .jar driver, perform queries, close connections and handle errors (all functions in main/src/NodeJdbcConnection.js). <br /><br />
Here&#039;s the database driver for integration (at the end of the page): https://support.adeptia.com/hc/en-us/articles/207874903-Connecting-to-SQL-Anywhere-10-Datasource<br /><br />
For connecting to the database, it&#039;s important that we can define the driver properties (see screenshot). <br /><br />
Why work with us?<br />
- Clear descriptions and goals.<br />
- Quick and effective communication.<br />
- Test environment/database available where you can test your integration.<br />
- No bullshit!<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $750

The most needed features will be:<br />
- Filtering and searching of skills and courses.<br />
- Skills related to course (in two languages)<br />
- Courses related to a skill (in two languages)<br />
- Publishing of skills/course visualization from Neo4J to webpage.<br />
- Recommendation of course to user according his skillgap.<br /><br />
1. Your first job is to receive the documentation and program and setup them to Google or Amazon Cloud environment (during 20.-21. July) for our experimental testing within one week (before 26. July).<br />
2. Secondly you should create and innovate web UI pages according our current visual design for users who want to use above mentioned features. The resulting webpages are for our internal testing.<br />
3. Adding thousands of new skills and professions to the database + analyzing them with AI with above system.<br />
4. Testing the functionality with larger data (100.000 skills). <br />
5. Some time after testing we want to continue working with you to integrate the new features with our current PostqreSQL/Java production environment and processes. Our co-operation with AI specialist can continue also after this.<br /><br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $5.00-$25.00
