I currently run a grid trading strategy on my Expert Advisor (EA). Here is an overview of how the strategy works:<br /><br />
Trigger for Trades: The opening of trades is dictated by candle closures. Specifically:<br />
A bearish candle results in a sell order.<br />
A bullish candle results in a buy order.<br />
Multiplicator and Fixed Lot: Each subsequent order uses a multiplicator and a fixed lot size.<br />
Step and Take Profit: There is a predetermined step between orders, and a take profit (TP) level is set for each trade.<br />
No Stop Loss: Currently, no stop loss is used in this strategy.<br />
Improvement Goals<br />
I want to improve the strategy to:<br /><br />
Limit risk while maintaining a profitability rate of 5-15% per month.<br />
Implement a hard stop loss based on a percentage of the account&#039;s equity.<br />
Integrate hedging to manage drawdown and profit when the EA is on the wrong side of the market, awaiting a retracement to hit the TP.<br />

This project supports both native (Android &amp;amp; IOS)&nbsp;&nbsp;and hybrid applications (React Native), ensuring comprehensive coverage across different platforms. <br /><br />
We are seeking assistance to test and validate our plugin:<br /><br />
- Testing will involve injecting the monitoring plugin using sample apps&nbsp;&nbsp;to assess functionality, performance, and overall user experience. <br />
- The scope of the testing includes functional testing and the benchmarking/comparison of the application performance before and after embedding the monitoring plugin. <br />
- You will also need to assess compliance with the relevant App Stores. <br />
- For native app testing, must use 2 sample apps each on Android and iOS and your testing must cover the latest 3 versions of the mobile platform.<br />
- For hybrid app testing, you must use 2 sample apps built using React Native with minimum and maximum versions.<br />
- The sample apps must include between at least 5-10 screens. Where possible, use sample apps available in the public domain.<br />
- You will need to be able to simulate different scenarios - e.g., app slowness, crashes, etc. <br /><br />
During the scope of the project, you will be provided access to the Web UI for analyzing and comparing metrics captured by the plugin.<br /><br />
